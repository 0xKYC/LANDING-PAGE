  "text": "We are a team of experienced blockchain developers who came together at ETHWarsaw in September 2022. Our decentralized app (dApp) allows users to obtain unique, soulbound tokens on the Ethereum network and soon on other networks like Polygon. Our dApp ensures users' personal information remains private and is only used to generate a zero-knowledge proof that verifies the user's uniqueness and OFAC sanctions status. This solution is used for anonymous verification in various use cases, such as DAO governance and NFT mints. We have the support of Outlier Ventures and New Order, and our team includes co-founders Adam and Dylan, a frontend engineer Sebastian, and a group of advisors who provide valuable contributions and support for our company. We are excited to bring our vision to our partners, including OKX Web3, IdentDefi and Cryptum."
